## Architecture

What computer architecture are you using? For example, Windows 32-bit or
FreeBSD 64-bit. Keep in mind that if your architecture is not being actively
supported by the dev team we may not be able to help you.

## Version

What version of the program are you running? If you don't know, you can check
by running the following command from your command-line:

> `swashrl -v`

Alternatively, you can press the 'v' key in-game.

If you can't run swashrl at all, either because it won't compile or you keep
getting errors, try checking your copy of the src/global.d source code file;
the four-digit version number will be represented by an enum named `VERSION`.

## Description

Describe the bug in as much detail as you can to give us a good idea of what
might have gone wrong. If you received an error message from the program, that
would be helpful.

## To Reproduce

Tell us what you were doing, step-by-step, when the bug occurred in as much
detail as you can.  Ideally we should be able to reproduce the problem using
the step-by-step description you give us.  If you can, go back into the
program and see if you can reproduce the error yourself.  If not, that's fine;
we'll still want to hear what you can remember.
