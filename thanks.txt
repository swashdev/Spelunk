SwashRL is dedicated:

  To Seb, who helped with a bunch of the number-crunching and design for the
  game as it will eventually exist, and has generally been the best mentor and
  friend I could have asked for

  To my family, who have been supportive above and beyond the call of duty and
  kept me in their prayers when I needed them most

  To Alec Holowka (1983-10-30 - 2019-08-31) A victim of the stigmatization of
  the independent gaming space and the video game industry in general,
  betrayed by former colleagues and abandoned by those he called his friends.
  Rest in peace--you will be missed.

Special thanks to the following "Honorary Dev Team Members," who contributed
significant help to the SwashRL source code:

  Elronnd, who has always been willing to provide help with SwashRL in
  general and with the translation into D in particular.

Further thanks to the following people who have contributed code or help in
some way:

  unleashy from GitHub, who explained how to fix PDCurses and allow it to
  compile with dub.

  Björn Bergström, who designed the recursive shadowcasting algorithm for fog
  of war, the Doryen implementation of which is used in SwashRL.
