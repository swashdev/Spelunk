Spelunk! is dedicated:

  To Seb, who helped with a bunch of the number-crunching and design for the
  game as it will eventually exist, and has generally been the best mentor and
  friend I could have asked for

  To my family, who have been supportive above and beyond the call of duty and
  kept me in their prayers when I needed them most

Special thanks to the following "Honorary Dev Team Members," who contributed
significant help to the Spelunk! source code:

  Elronnd, who has always been willing to provide help with Spelunk! in
  general and with the translation into D in particular.

Further thanks to the following people who have contributed code or help in
some way:

  Björn Bergström, who designed the recursive shadowcasting algorithm for fog
  of war, the Doryen implementation of which is used in Spelunk!
