Spelunk! is dedicated:

  To Seb, who helped with a bunch of the number-crunching and design for the
  game as it will eventually exist, and has generally been the best mentor and
  friend I could have asked for

  To my family, who have been supportive above and beyond the call of duty and
  kept me in their prayers when I needed them most

Further thanks to the following people who have contributed code or help in
some way:

  Elronnd, for diligent testing and code criticism, and for contributions
  related to the operating system detection in sys.h

  Björn Bergström, who designed the recursive shadowcasting algorithm for fog
  of war, the Doryen implementation of which is used in Spelunk!
