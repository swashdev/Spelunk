The version of SwashRL which you have received uses the following third-party
resources to function:

 -- DejaVu Fonts ------------------------------------------------------------

DejaVuSansMono, a freeware / open-source font, is included in the
``assets/fonts'' folder as the default font for the SDL interfaces to SwashRL.
DejaVuSansMono uses a few other fonts as a base, the licenses of which are
included with the DejaVu license notice.

The DejaVu fonts license can be found in ``docs/license/dejavu.txt''

  -- the Doryen library, aka libtcod -----------------------------------------

The source file ``src/fov.d'' uses modified versions of functions taken
directly from the libtcod source code.  In good faith, a comment line has been
added to indicate very specifically that it has been modified from its
original version.

The libtcod license can be found in ``docs/license/libtcod.txt''

  -- SmugglerRL --------------------------------------------------------------

Substantial portions of the Input/Output code in ``src/ioterm.d'' were
cannibalized from Elronnd's SmugglerRL project, which Elronnd graciously
allowed me to use as the base for my own SDL terminal interface.

The SmugglerRL git repository can be found here at the time of writing:
  http://repo.or.cz/SmugglerRL.git

The SmugglerRL license can be found in ``docs/license/smuggler.txt''
