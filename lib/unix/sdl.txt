There are no official release versions for the Linux or FreeBSD development
libraries of SDL2 or SDL_ttf, because of the variety of architectures that
those systems run on.  Please contact your distribution manager for updates.

Because these are standard and very popular libraries, I suggest you check
your package manager; they're probably in there, unless you're running a very
new or very small system like MINIX 3.
