On 2017-09-02, with the release of version 0.021 of Spelunk!, the git
repository was reset.  There are a few reasons for this: For one, the
repository was a mess, literally the first git repo I'd ever worked with, and
it was time for a fresh start.  For two, there was a new license agreement
being put up and this was a convenient time to reboot the project.  The real
reason, however, is that version 0.022 is going to come with some pretty major
overhauls of the codebase, to the point where it's going to be written in a
new language, so keeping the old C source files seemed a bit pointless.

With the change, this repository is going to see some restructuring, because
the way that branches were handled previously was part of the nightmare that
this reboot is meant to untangle.  As time goes on you'll notice a particular
pattern of activity in the development branches:

master will be reserved for development version releases, literally the
freshest copy of the code.

dev will be used for development in-between development versions, so
everything that happens in-between version numbers.

release will be used for actual release versions of the software.  When
version 1.000 eventually comes out, it will be on the release branch.

Please excuse our mess and do bear with us.  The old versions of the software
have been preserved and will eventually be released for historical purposes
rather than being re-committed into the repository like last time (god that
was a mistake)

Special thanks to Elronnd for helping me out with the code thus far, and for
teaching me how to use git.  Though your contributions have been erased by the
reboot they will always be remembered in thanks.txt.
